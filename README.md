# Striden: AI-Powered Footwear

Problem Statement

Many people—whether recovering from leg injuries, suffering from long-term posture issues, or even athletes seeking performance optimization—struggle with improper gait (walking/running patterns). Poor gait can lead to chronic pain, reduced mobility, and sports injuries. Current solutions are either too clinical (hospital-only) or inaccessible to everyday users.

# Solution Overview

Striden is an AI-powered smart shoe that uses load cells, gyroscopes, and pressure sensors embedded in the sole to analyze gait in real time. The sensor data is processed via an API that applies mathematical models to generate a personalized gait rating. This helps:

Patients monitor and improve rehabilitation progress

Athletes optimize stride and posture for better performance

Everyday users prevent long-term leg and posture issues

# SDG Goals Associated

SDG 3: Good Health & Well-Being – promotes rehabilitation, injury prevention, and healthier lifestyles

SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure – develops wearable innovation using AI and sensors

SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities – makes gait correction tools more accessible outside clinical spaces
