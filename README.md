Striden: AI-Powered Footwear

Problem Statement

Many people—whether recovering from leg injuries, suffering from long-term posture issues, or even athletes seeking performance optimization—struggle with improper gait (walking/running patterns). Poor gait can lead to chronic pain, reduced mobility, and sports injuries. Current solutions are either too clinical (hospital-only) or inaccessible to everyday users.
