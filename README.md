# 📘 Welcome to the IS Project Documentation Template!

Hey there! 👋

This repository is your home for documenting your **Innovation School Project** and starting your **maker portfolio**.  
You’ll be using the **GitHub Wiki** to update all your project details in a structured format.

---

## 🧠 What to Do First

Start by writing a **brief introduction** to your project right here in this `README.md` file:

🔹 What problem are you solving?  
🔹 What’s your proposed solution?

Just 2–3 lines are enough. This helps others quickly understand what your project is about.

Click on the ✏️ PENCIL icon next to the README title above, and you can edit the README directly from within your browser.

## 🛠 Where to Document Everything Else

We’ve already created a standard set of [**Wiki pages**](https://github.com/MakersAsylumIndia/Bowl-Buddy/wiki) for your project in this repository — you just need to **update them with your project information**.

Each section is ready with headings like:

- Project Title
- Problem Statement
- Bill of Materials (BOM)
- Solution Overview
- SDG Goals Associated
- Circuit & CAD Files
- Media Gallery
- License

Please **do not delete the headings** — just replace the placeholder content under each.
